- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DeQuayG
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cybersecurity and Cloud Engineering
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the small details of Authentication.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via dmglascoe@protonmail.com
- I write about my projects on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@dmglascoe)
- I'm currently working on a Secure S3 File Viewer App that dives into OAuth via an Auth0 Federated Login. Before that I was probably most recently tinkering in the "AzureProject" or "Webscraper2.0" repos. 
- You'll see a lot of pushes to private repos in my history, I'm working towards making those public!
